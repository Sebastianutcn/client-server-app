# Client/Server application in C
- This C code establishes a client-server connection using socket programming.
- The server, listening on port 22114, accepts incoming connections and communicates with clients.
- Upon connection, the server receives commands from clients. If a specific command ('08#') is received, it establishes a connection to a predefined IPv6 address and retrieves data from a website.
- The retrieved data is written to a file ('output.html') and simultaneously sent back to the client.
- The code handles error conditions, ensures proper closure of connections, and includes comments for clarity and understanding.
